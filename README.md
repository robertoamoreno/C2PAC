This script allows users to read and manipulate C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) metadata embedded in image files. It offers functionalities to extract binary data from the metadata and to remove all metadata from an image, saving the cleaned image as a new file.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
ExifTool by Phil Harvey
Setting Up Your Environment
Install Python:
Ensure that Python 3.6 or later is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website.

# Install ExifTool:
Download and install ExifTool from the official ExifTool website. Make sure it is accessible from your system's PATH so that it can be called from any command line interface.

# Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:


```
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your operating system:

On Windows:
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```


# Running the Script
To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it using Python, passing the image file path as an argument. You can also specify additional flags as needed.

# Basic Usage

```
python meta3.py path/to/your/image.jpg
```

# Extract Binary Data
To extract binary data from the C2PA metadata, use the --extract-binary flag:


python meta3.py --extract-binary path/to/your/image.jpg

# Remove All Metadata

To remove all metadata from the image and save it as a new file, use the --remove flag:


python meta3.py --remove path/to/your/image.jpg

# Notes
This script assumes that ExifTool is installed and accessible from your system's PATH.
The functionality related to C2PA metadata extraction and manipulation is based on the current understanding of C2PA standards. Adjustments may be necessary as standards evolve or based on specific metadata structures.

#License
Specify your license or state if the project is open-source and free to use.
